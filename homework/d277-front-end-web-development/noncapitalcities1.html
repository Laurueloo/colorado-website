            Before European settlement, the land that now makes up Aurora was the territory of multiple native american tribes. These lands
            were claimed by France in 1682 and became part of the 1803 purchase. Aurora originated in the 1880s as the town of fletcher taking
            its name from Denver businessman, Donald Fletcher who saw it as a real estate opportunity. By February 1928, the town of Aurora had reached a population
            over 2,000 and it was reincorporated as a city on March 9. Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city
            in the US during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

            Aurora's official elevation, posted on signs at the city limits, is 5,471 feet (1,668 m). However, the city spans a difference in elevation of nearly 1,000 feet (300 m). 
            The lowest elevation of 5,285 feet (1,611 m) is found at the point where Sand Creek crosses the city limit in the northwest corner of the city, while the highest elevation 
            of 6,229 feet (1,899 m) is on the extreme southern border of the city in Douglas County, near the intersection of Inspiration and Gartrell roads.[45] According to 2023 data 
            published by the United States census, the city has a total area of 104,696 acres (423.691 km2) including 371 acres (1.500 km2) of water.[6] The city is about 6 percent more 
            extensive than neighboring Denver but 80 percent of the size of Colorado Springs, ranking as the 54th-largest U.S. city in land area.
