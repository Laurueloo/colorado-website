            Loveland was known as a "sundown town." "Sundown towns" were racially segregated communities that excluded non-white travelers from remaining 
            in their borders after the sun set. "The primary purpose of these towns was to enforce racial purity and to create an environment where white 
            residents could live without any interaction with or proximity to Black individuals. These towns used intimidation, threats, and sometimes violence 
            to enforce their unwritten rules that people of color should leave Town before Sundown."[17]
