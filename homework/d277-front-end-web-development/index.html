            The region has been inhabited by Native Americans and their ancestors for the past 13,500 years and possible much longer.
            The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the US.
            the Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858-1862 created an influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, President James Buchanan
            signed an act creating the territory of Colorado and on August 1, president Ulysses S. Grant signed the proclamation
            230, admitting colorado to the union as the 38th state. The spanish adjective "colorado" means "colored red". Colorado
            is nicknamed the centennial state because it became a state 100 years after signing the Declaration of Independence.
